# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
ficulty levels, and creating a leaderboard for tracking high scores.

# Project Structure Explanation

### Root Directory (`quiz-app/`)
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- **`eslint.config.js`**: Configuration file for ESLint, a tool for identifying and fixing linting issues in JavaScript code.
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of dependencies installed via npm.
- **`package.json`**: Contains metadata about the project and lists dependencies and scripts.
- **`postcss.config.js`**: Configuration file for PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
- **`README.md`**: A markdown file that provides an overview and documentation for the project.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vite, a build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.

### `src/` Directory
- **`componens/`**: Contains React components.
  - **`ques.jsx`**: contains question array with options and their answer.
  - **`question.jsx`**: questions to display.
- **`context/`**: Contains context-related files for managing global state.
  - **`context.js`**: Defines the context and provides context-related functionality.
- **`App.css`**: Styles specific to the `App` component.
- **`App.jsx`**: The main React component that serves as the root of the application.
- **`index.css`**: Global CSS styles for the application.
- **`main.jsx`**: The entry point for the React application, where the root component is rendered.

This structure helps organize your project files logically, making it easier to manage and maintain.


## Conclusion
This Quiz App is a foundational project that demonstrates the basics of building a React application. It’s an excellent starting point for developers who want to practice their React skills or for those looking to create a more complex quiz platform. Future enhancements could include adding more questions, implementing difficulty levels, and creating a leaderboard for tracking high scores.
